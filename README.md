## 🎯 Overview

Transform abstract machine learning concepts into hands-on learning experiences! This platform bridges the gap between theory and practice by letting you interact with LEGO® SPIKE Prime Hub via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) while exploring:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Predict a fruit based on its length and color;
- **Linear Regression**: Build a robot that always hits the target;
- **Q-Learning**: Empower a self-learning crawler.

Built with modern web technologies: **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- LEGO® SPIKE Prime Hub
- Modern web browser with BLE support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/slavasg-lab/ml-with-bricks.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ml-with-bricks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Special Thanks

We also thank **[Yufeng (Eric) Wu](https://www.yufengwu.com/)** for answering our questions regarding communication between hub and website in the first stages of development, when it was the hardest for us. 

Moreover, we thank **[Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach](https://ceeo.tufts.edu/)** and its interns for inspiration and some small ideas we oversaw from their way of teaching machine learning using LEGO® SPIKE that made the course better.

Also thanks to **Prof. Val Rousseau** from Loyola University (New Orleans) for inspiring us when developing crawler ([video reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-kNXAFeffs)).

Also thanks **LEGO** for leaving an example of connection using BLE in Python: https://github.com/LEGO/spike-prime-docs/tree/main/examples/python
