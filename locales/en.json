    "dataCollectionTitle": "2. Data Collection",
    "dataCollectionText": "After connecting the hub and starting the code, it's time to collect data. Place the pitcher at a consistent launching position. Place a ball in the holder; ensure the serving arm is always at the 12 o'clock position, as this ensures consistent launches with sufficient acceleration time. In the web interface, start by setting the motor power to 20% (remember to click on 'Update motor speed' for changes to take effect). Click the 'Launch ball' button on the web platform to throw the ball. Observe where the ball lands. Hold a piece of cardboard at the point where the ball landed. The cardboard allows the distance sensor on the robot to reflect an ultrasonic signal and measure the distance the ball traveled. Click the 'Measure distance' button on the web platform to record this distance while holding the cardboard. The measured distance and the motor power used will be recorded in the web interface. Repeat these steps, trying different motor power values (e.g., 40%, 60%, 80%, up to 100%) for each launch.",
    "predictionTitle": "3. Prediction",
    "predictionText1": "If you observe the data points you've collected, you'll notice they roughly form a straight line. This suggests a linear relationship between the motor speed and the distance the ball travels. To predict the necessary motor speed to hit a target at a specific distance, the pitcher will use a machine learning technique called linear regression.",
    "predictionText2": "Linear regression is a method that finds the line that best represents the relationship between two variables – in our case, the distance to where the ball lands and the motor speed used to launch it.",
    "predictionText3": "To understand how well a line fits the data, we use a term called 'loss'. The loss represents the error between the line and the actual data points. For example, a simple way to calculate loss is to sum up the vertical distances between the regression line and each individual data point. A smaller loss value indicates a better-fitting line.",
    "predictionText4": "To find the best-fitting line, we need to minimize this loss. We can do this by adjusting the line's position, which is controlled by its intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis) and its slope (the line's steepness).",
    "predictionText5": "You can experiment with this yourself by switching the model mode to 'Prediction'. In this mode, you can manually adjust the slope and intercept parameters to try and minimize the loss visually on the graph. To see the parameters that the algorithm calculates as the best fit for your data, click the 'Calculate best parameters' button.",
    "predictionText6": "To try and hit a target, while in 'Prediction' mode, place some kind of target in front of the pitcher. Measure the distance to the target by holding a piece of cardboard at the target's location and clicking the 'Measure distance' button. Then, remove the cardboard, place the ball into the claw, and click the 'Launch ball' button. The robot will use the learned linear regression model to predict the motor speed needed to reach that distance.",
    "thingsToTryTitle": "4. Things to Try",
    "thingsToTryText": "Experiment with different distances and observe how the predicted motor power changes. Try adding more data points to see how it affects the accuracy of the linear regression line. You can also explore the 'Calculate Best Parameters' function to see the slope and intercept of the learned linear relationship."

    "algorithmTitle": "2. Algorithm",
    "algorithmText1": "The crawler will use reinforcement learning to learn how to crawl. To simplify this, it has only 4 arm positions, as shown in the reward diagram below. It needs to determine the best next position to move to from its current position.",
    "algorithmText2": "To select the best move, the crawler first needs to understand how effective each transition between arm positions is. The goal is to crawl as far as possible, so we measure the crawled distance to evaluate each transition.",
    "algorithmText3": "We create a 'Decision table' where the rows represent the current arm position and the columns represent the next possible arm positions. Each cell in this table contains a value indicating how good a transition is from the row's state to the column's state. Initially, these values are unknown, so the table is filled with zeros and will be updated with learned values during training.",
    "algorithmText4": "To learn these values, position the crawler with its distance sensor facing a wall at approximately one elbow's length away. Start the code by clicking the corresponding button on the web platform, set the exploration parameter to 'high', and click the 'play' button. A high exploration setting makes the crawler select a random movement in 80% of cases instead of always choosing the best known action. This encourages learning and prevents the crawler from getting stuck with a suboptimal movement. After the crawler has learned the distance it crawls with each transition, change the exploration parameter to 'none'. The crawler will now simply crawl by selecting the action that results in the greatest crawled distance.",
    "algorithmText5": "To ensure accurate measurements, the crawler will stop training if it is too close or too far from the wall. To continue training, simply reposition it at approximately one elbow's length from the wall and click the 'play' button again.",
    "warning1": "Make sure there are no objects between the wall and the distance sensor during training to ensure correct measurements.",
    "warning2": "To ensure accurate measurements, a crawler will stop training if it's too close or too far from the wall. To continue training, simply reposition it at ~1 elbow length to the wall and click play button again.",
    "thingsToTryTitle": "3. Things to try",
    "thingsToTryText": "Try resetting the experiment and repeating the training with 'Foresight' turned on. In this case, the crawler will also consider future rewards by adding the maximum value from the row it moves to (the next state) to the immediate crawled distance (the short-term reward). How did the decision table and the crawler's movements change?"
